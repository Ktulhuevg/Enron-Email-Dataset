# Enron-Email-Dataset
Project work done as part of Udacity's  Data Analyst Nanodegree course.

The [Enron Corpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_Corpus) is a large database of over 600,000 emails generated by 158 employees of the Enron Corporation and acquired by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation after the company's collapse.

Enron Email Dataset downloaded from : https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/.  
And it is the __May 7, 2015 Version of dataset__.

Running the `startup.py` file present in this repository will automatically download the tarred and gzipped dataset and extract it for usage.
